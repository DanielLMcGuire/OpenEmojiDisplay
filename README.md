# Open-EmojiDisplay

Open-EmojiDisplay is a Chrome extension, which replaces all emojis with the Apple Variant.

## The original is kept [Here](https://github.com/ranjotsingh/EmojiDisplay).
### This project will be kept in support as "Open-EmojiDisplay" by me.

e.g. Special characters 😀, 😁, 😂, 😃, etc. are replaced with graphics of Apple Emojis.
