# EmojiDisplay

EmojiDisplay is a Chrome extension, which replaces text versions of the emojis into images (for operating systems that do not automatically support this feature).

e.g. Special characters 😀, 😁, 😂, 😃, etc. are replaced with graphics of Apple Emojis.

## Installation
You can download the Google Chrome extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/emojidisplay/doomojimaojclkcipjldpmdbiedgaoop).

Note: The latest version is only available on this repository and is yet to be pushed to the Chrome Web Store.
