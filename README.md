# Open-EmojiDisplay

EmojiDisplay is a Chrome extension, which replaces text versions of the emojis into images (for operating systems that do not automatically support this feature).

## The original is kept [Here](https://github.com/ranjotsingh/EmojiDisplay).
### This project will be kept in support as "Open-EmojiDisplay" by me.

e.g. Special characters 😀, 😁, 😂, 😃, etc. are replaced with graphics of Apple Emojis.

## Installation
You can download the Google Chrome extension [here (Link BROKEN)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/emojidisplay/doomojimaojclkcipjldpmdbiedgaoop).
